## Overview:

This proof-of-concept Stocks app was a take-home assignment for an interview process I was going through, and it deals with using the Polygon.io API to retrieve stocks data.

## Demo:

## Set-up:

Clone the repository and build the app to your device or using the simulator. The app will ask you to provide a valid Polygon.io API key (which you will be able to paste into the provided text box), and will not work without it.

## Notes:

The Polygon.io API does not allow a free tier user to obtain data for the current date, hence the data shown is based on the last valid market close day (the most recent week day that isnâ€™t a holiday) and shows the daily change based on this and the prior valid market close day.

The Stock Detail view shows a line graph with data for the past 3 months.
